# Changelog

## [v0.2.1](https://github.com/napari/magicgui/tree/v0.2.1) (2020-12-29)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/napari/magicgui/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1)

v0.2.1 fixes some issues with the 0.2.0 release.  `ForwardRef` annotations are now resolved automatically on both parameter and return type annotations.  And the `orientation` parameter on `Container` widgets (such as those returned by the `magicgui` decorator) has been renamed back to `layout` as in <v0.2.0.  Test coverage is also improved.

**Fixed bugs:**

- napari examples in the docs are broken [\#72](https://github.com/napari/magicgui/issues/72)
- Functions without arguments are not finding napari parent widgets [\#64](https://github.com/napari/magicgui/issues/64)
- "Layout" parameter doesn't work anymore in recent dev version [\#54](https://github.com/napari/magicgui/issues/54)

**Closed issues:**

- Should we permanently resolve ForwardRef type annotations? [\#65](https://github.com/napari/magicgui/issues/65)
- Need consensus on "layout" vs "orientation" [\#63](https://github.com/napari/magicgui/issues/63)

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/napari/magicgui/tree/v0.2.0) (2020-12-26)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/napari/magicgui/compare/v0.1.6...v0.2.0)

v0.2.0 includes a complete rewrite of magicgui.  The primary goals were as follows:
- make a clean separation between the Qt backend and the end-use API, clarifying the interface that a backend must implement in order to work with magicgui
- create a "direct API" that enables procedural widget creation, with the potential for subclassing and custom widget creation
- create a more direct link between an individual widget and an `inspect.Parameter` object, and a collection or layout of widgets and an `inspect.Signature` object.

See PR #43  for full details of the rewrite.

**Deprecations and possible breaking changes!**

Some of the API has been deprecated or changed, though an attempt was made to make the pre-0.2.0 API still work (with warnings).  Please see the [v0.2.0 migration guide](https://napari.org/magicgui/api/v0_2_0.html) for details.

Lastly, we have new documentation, using the amazing [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) project!  Note the new url at https://napari.org/magicgui
